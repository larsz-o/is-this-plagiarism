# Plagiarism Guide

<div>

## Need a refresher on what constitutes plagiarism or some concrete examples on how to properly write about and cite texts you've read?

  

This guide is intended to help you understand some of the common
mistakes that students often make related to plagiarism to help you
avoid them. Please return to this resource as you find yourself unsure
about how to use sources or work with others. As always, you should
consult your instructor if you cannot determine if what you're doing
might be construed as plagiarism.

### Academic honesty and student integrity are of fundamental importance at Brandeis University and we want students to understand this clearly at the start of the term.

As stated in the Brandeis [Rights and
Responsibilities](https://www.brandeis.edu/studentlife/srcs/rightsresponsibilities/index.html)
handbook:

> Every member of the University Community is expected to maintain the
> highest standards of academic honesty. A student shall not receive
> credit for work that is not the product of the student’s own effort. A
> student's name on any written exercise constitutes a statement that
> the work is the result of the student's own thought and study, stated
> in the students’ own words, and produced without the assistance of
> others, except in quotes, footnotes or references with appropriate
> acknowledgement of the source.

Students must be aware that material (including ideas, phrases,
sentences, etc.) taken from the Internet and other sources ***must*** be
appropriately cited if quoted, and footnoted in any written work turned
in for this, or any, Brandeis class.

### Many students are unaware of how plagiarism and cheating are defined on the college and graduate school level.

Here are some examples of academically dishonest behaviors.

* Copying from another student's work to complete an assignment, i.e.
looking at work completed by a student who took your course last term
and copying their answers

* Incorporating published passages or websites into your own paper without
quotation marks and footnotes

* Representing someone else's words or ideas as your own on a paper or
exam

* Possession or use of unauthorized materials during an exam
Submitting the same assignment in more than one course without prior
approval from the instructors

* Unauthorized collaboration with another student on a paper or project
intended to be completed individually

* Completing an assignment or taking an exam for another student

* Sharing your own work with another student to help them satisfy a course
requirement

If you find yourself copying another student's work, or allowing another
student to copy your work - it is likely cheating. While you may have
good intentions in sharing work with other classmates, it's important to
ask your instructor about when it is okay to share and when work should
be completed individually. It is never okay to copy another student's
work and attempt to pass it off as your own. Doing so prevents you from
truly understanding the concepts on your own and puts you and the other
student at risk of punishment.

### Citing references and giving credit to other scholars' work is crucial to avoid plagiarism. Sometimes it's hard to know what to cite and how many citations is enough to differentiate your original ideas from a published author's ideas.

You will be citing other scholars' work as you write papers and
discussion forum posts. Engaging the work of other thinkers is a crucial
component of your graduate studies. When you cite other thinkers, you
contribute to an ongoing dialogue and enter into an intellectual
community. Most importantly, you give that scholar credit for their
work.

If you are asked to supplement your coursework with additional readings,
be sure to keep careful track of the title, author, publisher and date
of each piece you read and include them as references at the end of your
paper. For internet sources, be sure to include the URL.

You also must note any theory or concept which you were introduced to
through reading another author's work. Correct referencing demonstrates
your effort in preparing the assignment, and acknowledges your
understanding of the material. This means that any concept that is not
"common sense" should be cited. While common sense is a subjective term,
you can generally assume that something is common sense if most people
who are not specialists in your field would know this information. If
you're not sure if a concept is "common sense" or not, it's best to air
on the side of caution and include the citation.

### Let's dig into some examples of plagiarism.

Many instances of plagiarism are not necessarily intentional, but
instead the result of a student not fully understanding how to cite
their sources correctly. In the example below, we'll demonstrate some of
the different ways a student can write about an original course, copying nearly all of the text word for word.  In the next two examples, we demonstrate how a student could improve their writing to avoid plagiarism and put the key concepts into their own words while giving credit to the author that informed the student's insights.

Original source: *Bioinformatics Programming Using Python*, Mitchell L.
Model (2009).

Example of plagiarized student writing:

> "The history of object-oriented programming begins in the late 1960s.
> It was <span
> style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: rgb(255, 207, 53);">developed

> programming is now a mainstream paradigm today.</span>**<span
> style="background-color: rgb(255, 207, 53);">"</span>

The <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 207, 53);">highlighted
text</span> has been directly plagiarized from the original source. The
student did not cite their source nor did they explain the meaning in
their own words. The **bolded phrases** show where the student attempted
to alter the original source, moving around portions of the text to put it slightly in their own words. Moving phrases around in this manner is still considered plagiarism because the student rely heavily upon the original text and did not include any reference to the source nor the author. The paragraph has not paraphrased - articulated in the student's own words - and thus it constitutes plagiarism.

#### What could the student have done differently?

If the student wants to include the original ideas put forth by another
person, all they need to do is cite the author and explain the author's
ideas in their own words.

Example of good paraphrasing (not plagiarism):

> "Object-oriented programming emerged in the 1960s primarily in
> academic circles, not taking off into the mainstream until the 1980s
> and 90s. Software developer Mitchell Model explains that
> object-oriented programming's adoption in the commercial sector,
> through languages such as Java, C++, Smalltalk, and JavaScript,
> transformed the ways that software is developed today. Model writes,
> 'Once a radical innovation, object-oriented programming is today very
> much a mainstream paradigm' (2009)."

In this improved example, the student summarized the original source in
their own words. They gave credit by naming the author whose work they
were using and added in a direct quote to give evidence to the claims
that the author makes. Notice how the student is still able to convey
the important points that they learned from the author while also giving
credit in the form of paraphrasing and citation. The student gives
credit to the author's work in historicizing the development of
object-oriented programming while also signaling their own understanding
of this history by explaining it in their own words. 

Paraphrasing can be difficult when you're looking directly at a text and
trying to convey its meaning. It can help to read over the passage you
want to write about, then put the reading out of sight and try to write
a few sentences explaining what it is you want to say about it. Read
over your words and compare them to the original text. Do you rely on
any of the same phrases? If they are important phrases, you can add in a
quote. If not, try to write the sentences again avoiding those phrases.
It can help to think about how you would explain the concept to someone
with no background in this topic.

you paraphrase, you still have to cite the author, even if you don't
include a direct quote. </span>

> For instance, if the student decided not to use a quote in the previous
> example, their paragraph could look something like this:
> Object-oriented programming emerged in the 1960s primarily in academic circles, not taking off into the mainstream until the 1980s and 90s. Software developer Mitchell Model explains that object-oriented
> programming's adoption in the commercial sector, through languages such as Java, C++, Smalltalk, and JavaScript, transformed the ways that software is developed today (Model, 2009).

The student is still giving credit to the author and his ideas, even though they don't directly quote him. It's important to cite all of the authors that influence your work so that they get credit for their ideas and you can contribute to a broader scholarly community.

#### What are the consequences of plagiarism?
Students will not be allowed to collaborate on work except by the specific permission of the instructor. Failure to cite resources properly may result in a referral being made to the Director of Academic Integrity. The outcome of this action may involve academic and disciplinary sanctions, which could include (but are not limited to) such penalties as receiving no credit for the assignment in question, receiving no credit for the related course, or suspension or dismissal from the University.

### Okay, I understand what to do, but how do I actually cite my sources?

There are lots of great resources online to help you figure out how to
properly cite your sources. The [Brandeis University Library] website
has a comprehensive guide to using citations across multiple style
guides which you can access online.

We recommend the use of the [APA style guide] in Graduate Professional
Studies, which you can [access online through Brandeis][APA style guide]
as well.

[Purdue's Online Writing Lab] is a great resource for all of your
formatting needs. You can enter your source information into this site
and it will generate the correct formatting for you depending on the
context. 

If you find yourself collecting a large number of citations, you may
find a citation manager useful, such as [Zotero] or [EndNote]. These
tools help you keep track of the resources you're using and will
generate a bibliography for you that is properly formatted.
